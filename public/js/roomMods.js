// public/js/roomMods.js — what mod content this client is talking to, and what a room may declare (W-A, DESIGN §27.9).
//
// Two questions live here, and they are NOT the same one:
//
//   1. WHICH SET AM I CONNECTED TO? `welcome.mods` says what the server runs (DESIGN §27.2). The client must echo that
//      digest in `room.create` / `room.join`, or the server's gate refuses the room with BAD_MSG — a browser client
//      that never read `welcome.mods` could not enter a room on a modded server at all. `welcomeModSet` holds it, and
//      `buildCreatePayload` / `buildJoinPayload` are the ONLY place the digest is put on the wire.
//   2. WHICH SUBSET MAY THIS ROOM DECLARE? The host picks from the catalogue the server declared (`welcome.mods.packs`)
//      and the pick travels as `room.create.modIds`. The room's own set is a subset of what the server loaded, so a
//      client can never name content the server does not have; `ERR.MOD_UNKNOWN` is the server's answer if it ever did.
//
// The state is module-level and framework-agnostic on purpose: the UI renders it from the store (main.js writes
// `store.roomMods`), and a Node test can drive it without a DOM. `reset()` is what a test — or a fresh connection —
// uses to get back to "no mods".
//
// ▸ Absent means absent. On a plain install `welcome` has NO `mods` key, `welcomeModSet` stays null, and every payload
// builder here returns the fields it was given, byte-identical: no `mods`, no `modIds`, no empty object.
