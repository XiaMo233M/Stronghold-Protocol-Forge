// server/http/mods.js — the HTTP half of the CLIENT MOD STORE (W-C): what a browser downloads and caches locally.
//
// Two things live here, and both are deliberately narrow:
//
//   * `GET /mods/catalog.json` — the catalogue (server/modCatalog.js): every installed pack, its identity, and its file
//     list with the hashes a client verifies against. The URL follows the existing `/packs/index.json` precedent
//     (server/packs.js), the "the server publishes an index, the client chooses" pattern this reuses.
//   * `GET /mods/file/<pack>/<path>` — the BYTES of one pack file. A pack's kits and its art already have routes
//     (`/workshop-kits/`, `/workshop-assets/`); this one exists for the pack's own JSON (`pack.json`, `chess.json`) and
//     serves anything else the catalogue lists, so a client can cache the pack whole.
//
// A request is served only when BOTH hold: the path is inside the pack directory, and the path is in the pack's file
// list. The second check is the strong one — that list is what the loader hashed, so this route can never become a
// general file server for the game's own tree.
//
// The catalogue is built once per process (the pack set is fixed at load, DESIGN §27.2) and handed in already built:
// `serveMods` does no work per request beyond two map lookups.
//
// (i18n-ignore-file: the error titles are the bilingual `中文 · English` page text of server/http/common.js, not UI
// strings — docs/I18N.md)
